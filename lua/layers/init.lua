---
--- # Key Design Ideas ~
--- - Use |vim.fn.maparg| and |vim.fn.mapset| to preserve overlaid keymaps and
---   restore them later. This is encapsulated in the `map` component of this
---   plugin.
--- - Provide high level `mode` component to craft custom modes which can show a
---   visual help for overlaid keymaps.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- Use `require('layers').setup({})` (|Layers.setup|) to apply configuration
--- globally and create the global Lua table `Layers` that you can use
--- in your config to create |Layers.map|s and |Layers.mode|s.
---

--- Layers is the main table exposed by |layers.nvim|. It allows access to
--- |Layers.map| and |Layers.mode|, which expose the core functionalities of
--- |layers.nvim|.
---
--- Any functionality can be configured globally by using |Layers.setup|, which
--- will globally export a `Layers` object for convenient access in configs.
--- The |Layers.config| section details the default options used by the |Layers|
--- components.

---
---@field config layers.setup_opts
---@field setup fun(opts:layers.setup_opts):layers
---@field map layers.map
---@field mode layers.mode
---
---@type layers
local Layers = {}

--- These are the default values that users can modify and add to using
--- |Layers.setup|. All options take effect globally for new instances of
--- |Layers.mode|. There are currently no options used by |Layers.map|.
